# E-Commerce-Sales-Customer-Insights-Analysis
# 📊 E-Commerce Sales & Customer Insights Analysis

## 🚀 Project Overview
E-commerce businesses operate in a highly competitive digital marketplace where understanding customer behavior and optimizing sales strategies are crucial for growth. This project leverages a structured data-driven approach to analyze online retail transaction data, uncover key revenue drivers, and propose actionable insights for business expansion.

By integrating Python, SQL, Excel, and Machine Learning, this study transforms raw transaction records into meaningful business intelligence, helping stakeholders make informed decisions regarding customer segmentation, marketing strategies, pricing models, and inventory management.

The core objectives of this project include:

Cleaning and structuring raw transaction data for accurate analysis.

Storing and retrieving data efficiently using a relational database.

Exploring sales trends, customer purchase behavior, and product performance.

Conducting statistical tests to validate business hypotheses.

Developing predictive models to forecast repeat purchases and high-value transactions.

Delivering key recommendations to enhance revenue, optimize promotions, and improve customer retention.

## 🎯 Objectives

### 🔹 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python)**

✅ Load and explore raw data.

✅ Cleanse missing values, remove duplicates, and correct data types.

✅ Handle invalid entries like negative quantities or prices.


### 🔹 **Data Storage & Retrieval (SQL)**

✅ Store the cleaned dataset in a relational database (SQLite/PostgreSQL).

✅ Query sales trends, top products, and customer behaviors.

✅ Perform SQL joins and aggregations for advanced analysis.


### 🔹 **Exploratory Analysis & Dashboards (Excel)**

✅ Export relevant data for visualization.

✅ Create Pivot Tables and Charts to uncover insights.

✅ Identify seasonality, best-selling products, and high-value customers.


### 🔹 **Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing (Python)**

✅ Validate business hypotheses (e.g., impact of discounts on revenue).

✅ Apply statistical tests (t-tests, chi-square) to extract meaningful patterns.

✅ Interpret results for strategic decision-making.


### 🔹 **Predictive Modeling (Machine Learning)**

✅ Develop a classification model to predict repeat purchases.

✅ Train and evaluate models with key metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

✅ Optimize performance through hyperparameter tuning.


### 🔹 **Business Insights & Recommendations**

✅ Identify key revenue drivers and customer segments.

✅ Provide actionable strategies for marketing, pricing, and inventory management.

✅ Summarize findings in a structured executive report.
