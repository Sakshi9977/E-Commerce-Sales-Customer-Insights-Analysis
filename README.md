# 📊 E-Commerce Sales & Customer Insights Analysis

## 🚀 Project Overview
Welcome to the **E-Commerce Sales & Customer Insights Analysis** project! This initiative is designed to unlock valuable insights from online retail transaction data, enabling data-driven decision-making to boost sales and enhance customer satisfaction.

## 🎯 Objectives
### 🔹 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python)**
✅ Load and explore raw data.

✅ Cleanse missing values, remove duplicates, and correct data types.

✅ Handle invalid entries like negative quantities or prices.

### 🔹 **Data Storage & Retrieval (SQL)**
✅ Store the cleaned dataset in a relational database (SQLite/PostgreSQL).

✅ Query sales trends, top products, and customer behaviors.

✅ Perform SQL joins and aggregations for advanced analysis.

### 🔹 **Exploratory Analysis & Dashboards (Excel)**
✅ Export relevant data for visualization.

✅ Create Pivot Tables and Charts to uncover insights.

✅ Identify seasonality, best-selling products, and high-value customers.

### 🔹 **Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing (Python)**
✅ Validate business hypotheses (e.g., impact of discounts on revenue).

✅ Apply statistical tests (t-tests, chi-square) to extract meaningful patterns.

✅ Interpret results for strategic decision-making.

### 🔹 **Predictive Modeling (Machine Learning)**
✅ Develop a classification model to predict repeat purchases.

✅ Train and evaluate models with key metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

✅ Optimize performance through hyperparameter tuning.

### 🔹 **Business Insights & Recommendations**
✅ Identify key revenue drivers and customer segments.

✅ Provide actionable strategies for marketing, pricing, and inventory management.

✅ Summarize findings in a structured executive report.
